# The-Adjustable-Key-
I completed a CAD engineering group project using SolidWorks to design an easily adjustable key. The key was aimed at helping college students avoid the high cost of replacing lost keys, which can sometimes amount to hundreds of dollars. My main contribution was the idea and the modeling of the key.
